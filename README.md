# extra things:
# - I have way more than 16 knots
# - Instead of an inventory that holds items that allow you to do different things, my game has a class system. Each class has different abilities and weapons. 
# - There is a leveling system. After you slay the wolf, the player levels up to level 2, which upgrades all abilities and the player's maximum health.
# - There aren't many opportunities to backtrack, but when there are, the introduction line is either omitted or slightly changed.
